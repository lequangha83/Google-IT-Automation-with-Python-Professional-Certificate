#Infinite Loops and How to Break Them

def print_range(start, end):
    # Loop through the numbers from start to end
    n = start
    while n <= end:
        print(n)

print_range(1, 5)  # Should print 1 2 3 4 5 (each number on its own line) 

# Basic For Loop question. Why is it loop forever?
# Your loop variable, n, is not changed within the while loop so it always stays equal to start and thus it is (likely) less than end forever.
# Add n = n+1 to the loop


def print_range(start, end):
    # Loop through the numbers from start to end
    n = start
    while n <= end:
        print(n)
        n += 1
 print_range(1, 5)  # Should print 1 2 3 4 5 (each number on its own line)
